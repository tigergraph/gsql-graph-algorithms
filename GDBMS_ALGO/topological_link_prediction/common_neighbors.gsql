    Maturity:
        production

    Description: 
        This query calculates the number of common neighbors between two vertices.
        The higher the number, the closer two vertices are.

    Publications:
        NA

    TigerGraph Documentation:

    Parameters:
        v_source:
            Input vertex one
        v_target:
            Input vertex two
        e_type_set:
            edge types to traverse. If all edge types are desired, pass in "ALL" to the set.
        print_results:
            if True, print result (True by default)
