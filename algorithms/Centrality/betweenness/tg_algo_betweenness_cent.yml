    name: Betweenness Centrality
    filename: "tg_betweenness_cent.gsql"
    sha_id: ed6ea869749977cc0f3df71225d7325fb81c9767
    description: The Betweenness Centrality of a vertex is defined as the number of shortest paths that pass through this vertex, divided by the total number of shortest paths.
    schema_constraints: If you want to write the results of this algorithm (FLOAT) back to the vertices, you must have a FLOAT attribute on the target vertex type.
