    description: The Approximate Closeness Centrality algorithm (based on Cohen et al. 2014) calculates the approximate closeness centrality score for each vertex by combining two estimation approaches - sampling and pivoting. This hybrid estimation approach offers near-linear time processing and linear space overhead within a small relative error. It runs on graphs with unweighted edges (directed or undirected).
