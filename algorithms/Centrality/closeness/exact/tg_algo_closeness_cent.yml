    name: Closeness Centrality
    filename: "tg_closeness_cent.gsql"
    sha_id: ed6ea869749977cc0f3df71225d7325fb81c9767
    description: "Calculates the exact closeness centrality of an algorithm. This algorithm might be time-consuming on large graphs when compared to the approximate version."
    schema_constraints: If you want to write the results of this algorithm (FLOAT) back to the vertices, you must have a FLOAT attribute on the target vertex type.
