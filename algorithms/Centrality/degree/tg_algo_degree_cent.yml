    name: Degree Centrality
    filename: "tg_degree_cent.gsql"
    sha_id: ed6ea869749977cc0f3df71225d7325fb81c9767
    description: Degree centrality is defined as the number of edges incident upon a node (i.e., the number of ties that a node has). The degree can be interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of a node for catching whatever is flowing through the network (such as a virus, or some information).
    schema_constraints: If you want to write the results of this algorithm (FLOAT) back to the vertices, you must have a FLOAT attribute on the target vertex type.
