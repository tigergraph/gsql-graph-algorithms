    description: Eigenvector centrality (also called eigencentrality or prestige score) is a measure of the influence of a vertex in a network. Relative scores are assigned to all vertices in the network based on the concept that connections to high-scoring vertices contribute more to the score of the vertex in question than equal connections to low-scoring vertices. A high eigenvector score means that a vertex is connected to many vertices who themselves have high scores.
    schema_constraints: If you want to write the results of this algorithm (FLOAT) back to the vertices, you must have a FLOAT attribute on the target vertex type.
