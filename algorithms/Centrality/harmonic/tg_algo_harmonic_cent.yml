    name: Harmonic Centrality
    filename: "tg_harmonic_cent.gsql"
    sha_id: ed6ea869749977cc0f3df71225d7325fb81c9767
    description: The Harmonic Centrality algorithm calculates the harmonic centrality of each vertex in the graph. Harmonic Centrality is a variant of Closeness Centrality. In a (not necessarily connected) graph, the harmonic centrality reverses the sum and reciprocal operations in the definition of closeness centrality.
    schema_constraints: If you want to write the results of this algorithm (FLOAT) back to the vertices, you must have a FLOAT attribute on the target vertex type.
