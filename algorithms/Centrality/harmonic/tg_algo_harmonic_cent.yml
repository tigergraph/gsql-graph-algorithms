    name: Harmonic Centrality
    filename: "tg_harmonic_cent.gsql"
    sha_id: ed6ea869749977cc0f3df71225d7325fb81c9767
    description: "Calculates the harmonic centrality of each vertex in the graph. Harmonic centrality is a variant of closeness centrality."
    schema_constraints: If you want to write the results of this algorithm (FLOAT) back to the vertices, the target vertex type must have a FLOAT attribute.
