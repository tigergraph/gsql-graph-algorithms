    description: Influence maximization is the problem of finding a small subset of vertices in a social network that could maximize the spread of influence. There are two versions of the Influence Maximization algorithm. Both versions find k vertices that maximize the expected spread of influence in the network. The CELF version improves upon the efficiency of the greedy version and should be preferred in analyzing large networks.
    schema_constraints: This algorithm also requires a FLOAT attribute on the target edge types representing weight or influence.
