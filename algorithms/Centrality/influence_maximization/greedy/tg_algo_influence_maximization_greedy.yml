    description: Influence maximization is the problem of finding a small subset of vertices in a social network that could maximize the spread of influence. There are two versions of the Influence Maximization algorithm. Both versions find k vertices that maximize the expected spread of influence in the network.
    schema_constraints: This algorithm also requires a FLOAT attribute on the target edge types representing weight or influence.
