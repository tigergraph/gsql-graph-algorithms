    description: "The PageRank algorithm measures the influence of each vertex on every other vertex. PageRank influence is defined recursively: a vertex’s influence is based on the influence of the vertices which refer to it. A vertex’s influence tends to increase if (1) it has more referring vertices or if (2) its referring vertices have higher influence. The analogy to social influence is clear. The only difference between weighted PageRank and standard PageRank is that edges have weights, and the influence that a vertex receives from an in-neighbor is multiplied by the weight of the in-edge."
    schema_constraints: If you want to write the results of this algorithm (FLOAT) back to the vertices, you must have a FLOAT attribute on the target vertex type. This algorithm also requires a FLOAT attribute on the target edge types representing weight or influence.
