    description: "The PageRank algorithm measures the influence of each vertex on every other vertex. PageRank influence is defined recursively: a vertex’s influence is based on the influence of the vertices which refer to it. A vertex’s influence tends to increase if (1) it has more referring vertices or if (2) its referring vertices have higher influence. The analogy to social influence is clear. In the original PageRank, the damping factor is the probability of the surfer continues browsing at each step. The surfer may also stop browsing and start again from a random vertex. In personalized PageRank, the surfer can only start browsing from a given set of source vertices both at the beginning and after stopping. "
