    description: The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm is one of the simplest classification algorithms. It assumes that some or all the vertices in the graph have already been classified. The classification is stored as an attribute called the label. The goal is to predict the label of a given vertex, by seeing what are the labels of the nearest vertices. This algorithm is a batch version of the k-Nearest Neighbors, Cosine Neighbor Similarity, single vertex. It makes a prediction for every vertex whose label is not known (i.e., the attribute for the known label is empty), based on its k nearest neighbors' labels.
