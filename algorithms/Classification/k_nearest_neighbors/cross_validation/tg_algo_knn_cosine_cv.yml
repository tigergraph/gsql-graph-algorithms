    description: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) is often used for machine learning. You can choose the value for topK based on your experience, or using cross-validation to optimize the hyperparameters. In our library, Leave-one-out cross-validation for selecting optimal k is provided. Given a k value, we run the algorithm repeatedly using every vertex with a known label as the source vertex and predict its label. We assess the accuracy of the predictions for each value of k, and then repeat for different values of k in the given range. The goal is to find the value of k with highest predicting accuracy in the given range, for that dataset.
