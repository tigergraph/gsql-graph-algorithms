    description: A strongly connected component (SCC) is a subgraph such that there is a path from any vertex to every other vertex. In addition to the regular strongly connected component algorithm, we also provide a version that is optimized for small-world graphs. A small world graph in this context means the graph has a hub community, where a vast majority of the vertices of the graph are weakly connected.
