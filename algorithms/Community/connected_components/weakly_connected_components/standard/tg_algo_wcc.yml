    description: A component is the maximal set of vertices, plus their connecting edges, which are interconnected. If you have directed edges but ignore the direction (permitting traversal in either direction), then the algorithm finds Weakly Connected Components.
    schema_constraints: This algorithm can optionally write the ID (INT) of the strongly connected component that each vertex belongs to, if the vertex has an INT attribute.
