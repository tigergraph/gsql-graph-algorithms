    name: K-Core
    filename: "tg_kcore.gsql"
    sha_id: ed6ea869749977cc0f3df71225d7325fb81c9767
    description:  "Takes a range of values for k and returns the set of the vertices that constitute the k-core with the highest possible value of k within the range. A k-core of a graph is a maximal connected subgraph in which every vertex is connected to at least k vertices in the subgraph. "
    schema_constraints: This algorithm can optionally write the 'core level' (INT) to each vertex respectively, if the vertex has an INT attribute.
