    description: A k-core of a graph is a maximal connected subgraph in which every vertex is connected to at least k vertices in the subgraph. To obtain the k-core of a graph, the algorithm first deletes the vertices whose outdegree is less than k. It then updates the outdegree of the neighbors of the deleted vertices, and if that causes a vertexâ€™s outdegree to fall below k, it will also delete that vertex. The algorithm repeats this operation until every vertex left in the subgraph has an outdegree of at least k.
    schema_constraints: This algorithm can optionally write the 'core level' (INT) to each vertex respectively, if the vertex has an INT attribute.
