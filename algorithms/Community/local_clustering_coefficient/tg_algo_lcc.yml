    description: The Local Clustering Coefficient algorithm computes the local clustering coefficient of every vertex in a graph. The local clustering coefficient of a vertex (node) in a graph quantifies how close its neighbors are to being a complete graph, where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. It is obtained by dividing the number edges between a vertexâ€™s neighbors by the number of edges that could possibly exist.
    schema_constraints: This algorithm can optionally write the clustering coefficient (FLOAT) to each vertex, if the vertex has a FLOAT attribute.
