  algorithm:
    name: Map Equation

    description: The library is currently under construction! Descriptions will be added soon.
    schema_constraints: This algorithm uses a weight attribute (FLOAT) to calculate the map equation, so the target edge type needs a FLOAT attribute representing weight or influence. This algorithm also uses a STRING attribute representing community id, so the vertex type needs a STRING attribute. Note, however, that it is trivial to change the expected datatypes.
