    description: "Generates node embeddings of low dimensionality through random projections from the graph's adjacency matrix (a high-dimensional matrix) to a low-dimensional matrix, significantly reducing the computing power required for data processing. "
    schema_constraints: This algorithm can optionally write the embedding results back to the graph if the target vertex type(s) have a list attribute of type DOUBLE.
