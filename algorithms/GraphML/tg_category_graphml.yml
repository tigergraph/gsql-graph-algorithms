  description: "The algorithms in this category deal with the problem of Graph Embedding. Embedding refers to the process of representing vertices, edges, or even entire graphs in a format (typically a numerical vector) that either condenses the 'information' of the object or exposes information about the object such that it can be used for a downstream task such as machine learning classification."
