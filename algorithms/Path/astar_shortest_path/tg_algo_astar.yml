    description: A* (pronounced A-star) is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which achieves better performance by using heuristics to guide its search.
    schema_constraints: This algorithm requires latitude (FLOAT) and longitude (FLOAT) attributes on the target vertex types and a weight (FLOAT) attribute on the target edge types.
