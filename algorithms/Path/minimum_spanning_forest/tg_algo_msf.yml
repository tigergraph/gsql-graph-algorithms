    name: Minimum Spanning Forest
    filename: "tg_msf.gsql"

    description: "Given an undirected graph with one or more connected components, a minimum spanning forest is a set of minimum spanning trees, one for each component. The library implements the algorithm in section 6.2 of Qin et al. 2014: http://www-std1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~hcheng/paper/SIGMOD2014qin.pdf."
    schema_constraints: This algorithm requires an INT, FLOAT, or DOUBLE weight attribute on the target edge types. This algorithm can also optionally write the result (BOOL) to a BOOL attribute on the respective vertices included in the MSF.
