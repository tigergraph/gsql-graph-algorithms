  algorithm:
    name: Minimum Spanning Tree
    filename: "tg_mst.gsql"
    sha_id: ed6ea869749977cc0f3df71225d7325fb81c9767
    description: "Returns a set of edges forming a minimum spanning tree for a connected component."
    schema_constraints: This algorithm requires an INT, FLOAT, or DOUBLE weight attribute on the target edge types. This algorithm can also optionally write the result (BOOL) to a BOOL attribute on the respective vertices included in the MST.
