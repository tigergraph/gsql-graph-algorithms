    name: Minimum Spanning Tree

    description: Given an undirected and connected graph, a minimum spanning tree is a set of edges that can connect all the vertices in the graph with the minimal sum of edge weights. The library implements a parallel version of Primâ€™s algorithm.
    schema_constraints: This algorithm requires an INT, FLOAT, or DOUBLE weight attribute on the target edge types. This algorithm can also optionally write the result (BOOL) to a BOOL attribute on the respective vertices included in the MST.
