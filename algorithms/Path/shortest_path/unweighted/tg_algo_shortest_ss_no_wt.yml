    name: Single Source Shortest Path (Unweighted)
    filename: "tg_shortest_ss_no_wt.gsql"
    sha_id: ed6ea869749977cc0f3df71225d7325fb81c9767
    description: If a graph has unweighted edges, then finding the shortest path from one vertex to another is the same as finding the path with the fewest hops. Think of Six Degrees of Separation and Friend of a Friend. Unweighted Shortest Path answers the question "How are you two related?" The two entities do not have to be persons. Shortest Path is useful in a host of applications, from estimating influences or knowledge transfer, to criminal investigation.
    schema_constraints: This algorithm can optionally write the result (INT) to an attribute of the respective type on each visited vertex.
