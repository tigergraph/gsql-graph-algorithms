  algorithm:
    name: Single Source Shortest Path (Weighted, Any Sign)
    filename: "tg_shortest_ss_any_wt.gsql"
    sha_id: ed6ea869749977cc0f3df71225d7325fb81c9767
    description: "Returns the shortest path in a graph with weighted positive or negative edges. If there is more than one path with the same total weight, returns one of them."
    schema_constraints: This algorithm requires an INT, FLOAT, or DOUBLE weight attribute on the target edge types. This algorithm can also optionally write the result (INT, FLOAT, or DOUBLE) to an attribute of the respective type on each visited vertex.
