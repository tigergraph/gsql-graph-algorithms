  algorithm:
    name: Single Source Shortest Path (Weighted, Positive-Only, Traceback)
    filename: "tg_shortest_ss_pos_wt_tb.gsql"
    sha_id: ed6ea869749977cc0f3df71225d7325fb81c9767
    description: "Prints the shortest paths from the start vertex to all other vertices in the graph."
    schema_constraints: This algorithm requires an INT, FLOAT, or DOUBLE weight attribute on the target edge types. This algorithm can also optionally write the result (FLOAT) to an attribute of the respective type on each visited vertex.
    version: lib3.0
