    name: Neighborhood Cosine Similarity (All Pairs)
    filename: "tg_cosine_nbor_ap_batch.gsql"
    sha_id: ed6ea869749977cc0f3df71225d7325fb81c9767
    description: "Calculates the cosine similarity between each vertex and every other vertex with which it has at least one shared neighbor based on their connections to their shared neighbors."
    schema_constraints: This algorithm requires a FLOAT weight attribute on the target edge types. This algorithm can also optionally insert edges between the relevant vertex types, if such an edge type exists with a FLOAT attribute representing the similarity score.
