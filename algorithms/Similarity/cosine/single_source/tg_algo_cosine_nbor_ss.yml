    name: Neighborhood Cosine Similarity (Single Source)

    description: To compare two vertices by cosine similarity, the selected properties of each vertex are first represented as a vector. For example, a property vector for a Person vertex could have the elements age, height, and weight. Then the cosine function is applied to the two vectors.
    schema_constraints: This algorithm requires a FLOAT weight attribute on the target edge types. This algorithm can also optionally insert edges between the relevant vertex types, if such an edge type exists with a FLOAT attribute representing the similarity score.
