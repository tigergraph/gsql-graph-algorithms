  algorithm:
    name: Neighborhood Jaccard Similarity (All Pairs)
    filename: "tg_jaccard_nbor_ap_batch.gsql"
    sha_id: ed6ea869749977cc0f3df71225d7325fb81c9767
    description: This algorithm computes the same similarity scores as the Jaccard similarity of neighborhoods, single-source algorithm, except that it considers ALL pairs of vertices in the graph (for the vertex and edge types selected by the user). Naturally, this algorithm will take longer to run. For very large and very dense graphs, this algorithm may not be a practical choice.
    schema_constraints: This algorithm can optionally insert edges between the relevant vertex types, if such an edge type exists with a FLOAT attribute representing the similarity score.
