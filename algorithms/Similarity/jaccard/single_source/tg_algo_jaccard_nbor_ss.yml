    description: The Jaccard index measures the relative overlap between two sets. To compare two vertices by Jaccard similarity, first select a set of values for each vertex. For example, a set of values for a Person could be the cities the Person has lived in. Then the Jaccard index is computed for the two vectors.
    schema_constraints: This algorithm can optionally insert edges between the relevant vertex types, if such an edge type exists with a FLOAT attribute representing the similarity score.
