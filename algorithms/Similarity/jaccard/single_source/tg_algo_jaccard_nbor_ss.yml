    name: Neighborhood Jaccard Similarity (Single Source)
    filename: "tg_jaccard_nbor_ss.gsql"
    sha_id: ed6ea869749977cc0f3df71225d7325fb81c9767
    description: "Calculates the Jaccard index between a given source vertex and every other vertex with which it has at least one shared neighbor based on their connections to their shared neighbors."
    schema_constraints: This algorithm can optionally insert edges between the relevant vertex types, if such an edge type exists with a FLOAT attribute representing the similarity score.
