    This query calculates the preferential attachment value between two vertices.
    Higher the number, the closer two vertices are.

    Preferential attachment is calculated by multiplying the number of each input vertices neighbors together.

    Parameters :
        a : Input vertex one
        b : Input vertex two
        e_type: edge types to traverse. If all edge types are desired, pass in "ALL" to the set.
        print_res: Boolean of if you want to print result (True by default)
