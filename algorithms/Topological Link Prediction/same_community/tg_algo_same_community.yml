    name: Same Community

    description: This algorithm takes two vertices, and returns 1 if they two vertices are in the same community, and returns 0 if they are not in the same community.
    schema_constraints: This algorithm requires an attribute of type UINT, INT, or STRING on the target vertex types, which represents each vertex's respective community ID.
