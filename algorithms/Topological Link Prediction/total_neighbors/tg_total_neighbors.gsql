    This query calculates the number of total neighbors of two vertices.
    Higher the number, the closer two vertices are.

        a : Input vertex one
        b : Input vertex two
        e_type: edge types to traverse. If all edge types are desired, pass in "ALL" to the set.
        print_res: Boolean of if you want to print result (True by default)
